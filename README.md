### 1. server.c and client.c
demonstrates a basic TCP client–server application in C, where the server listens on port 8080, receives a message from a client, replies with a greeting, and then closes the connection.

Compile: *gcc server.c -o server* and *gcc client.c -o client*

start the server first: *./server*

In another terminal, run the client: *./client*
